# common-sh

a *library* (i use the term extremely liberally) of *Bourne* shell functions
(`sh` not `bash`, but most of the functions should work in `bash` too i guess) in
an attempt to make writing bourne shell scripts somewhat quickier.

## usage

Either copy+paste the functions that you want into your sciprt, or source the entire file
for the *everything* (although idk why you'd want to do this, then you'd have to
distribute `common.sh`... w/e). a lot of the functions are interdependent on each other,
but the comment above the function should explain which other functions it depends on.

## the good part!
