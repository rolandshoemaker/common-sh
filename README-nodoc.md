a *library* (i use the term ***extremely*** liberally) of *Bourne* shell functions
(`sh` not `bash`, but most of the functions should work in `bash` too i guess) in
an attempt to make writing bourne shell scripts somewhat quickier.

also I wrote a python tool (`quick-doc.py`) for generating markdown from comments
in shell scripts based on the following comment format

```sh
# desc: this is the description, any *markdown* can be
# desc: put here since we are just passing it through
# desc: as markdown!
# usage: function "argument" [optional argument]
# requires: required_function another_required
a_function() {
	echo "woop woop"
}
```

output of it can be seen [here](#the-good-part)!

## usage

Either copy+paste the functions that you want into your sciprt, or source the entire file
for the *everything* (although idk why you'd want to do this, then you'd have to
distribute `common.sh`... w/e). a lot of the functions are interdependent on each other,
but the comment above the function should explain which other functions it depends on.

## the good part!
